# Data-Driven-Decision-Making-in-Hospitality
This project leverages data analytics to uncover key insights in hotel bookings, occupancy, revenue, and guest satisfaction to support strategic decision-making in the hospitality industry. 

## 🧾 Project Overview
This project applies data analytics to the hospitality domain, uncovering crucial insights for hotel management related to booking trends, occupancy, revenue, and guest feedback. Through a comprehensive analysis of operational, sales, customer, and property datasets, the project enables data-driven improvements across hotel chain operations. The Jupyter Notebook guides you through data cleaning, exploration, and in-depth analysis, revealing patterns and actionable recommendations for better decision-making in hospitality management.

## 📝 Problem Satatement
The hospitality industry faces challenges in:
- Understanding booking patterns, customer preferences, and revenue drivers
- Optimizing room occupancy rates and resource allocation across properties
- Evaluating the performance of booking platforms and room categories
- Monitoring guest satisfaction and analyzing feedback for continuous improvement
- Empowering management with timely, data-driven insights to inform strategy

## 🔑 Key Metrics Analyzed
- Overall and per-property occupancy rate, capacity utilization
- Booking volume and status (Checked Out, Cancelled, No Show)
- Revenue generated and realized across properties, room types, and channels
- Ratings/feedback distribution from guests
- Breakdown of bookings by booking platform, customer segment, and city
- Patterns by time (day, week, month) and day-type (weekday/weekend)

## 💻 Tech Stack
- Python & Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization
- pandas and numpy for data manipulation and exploration
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visual insights
- Raw hotel booking, property, and calendar data (CSV/Excel)

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- Step-by-step data exploration, cleaning, and transformation for real-life datasets
- Analysis of bookings, cancellations, and revenue at multiple aggregation levels
- Occupancy heatmaps, time-series trends, and segmentation by room type, city, and property
- Identification of key drivers for revenue and guest satisfaction
- Actionable insights for improving occupancy, optimizing revenue, and enhancing customer service
- Well-documented notebook, making the process easily reproducible and extensible

## 📈 Insights & Tackaways
- High variability in occupancy and booking volume across properties, days, and channels
- Certain room types and properties show consistently higher occupancy and satisfaction scores
- Direct online bookings and specific platforms can drive higher realized revenue
- Seasonal and day-type (weekday vs weekend) trends play a crucial role in capacity planning
- Targeted interventions—optimized pricing, focused marketing, improved guest experience—can significantly lift both revenue and guest retention
